# Pong Game with Machine Learning Model
This is a project that I created for a co-op with discovery lab global. All that is needed to run the code is a jupyter notebook enviormnet. 

There is extensive doccumentation in the paper that i wrote for this titled Technical Doccumentation. This is an 83 page paper that coveres the code and what I did to create it.
